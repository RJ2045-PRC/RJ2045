**CHE5886 Biopolymers**

**Executive Group Report #1 Polysaccharides (10%)**

# Due: Monday, Week 5, 11.55 pm

Your group should evaluate the properties, uses and industrial applications of one polysaccharide.    

·     <span style="background:#b1ffff">Pectin</span>

# Report Structure

The report structure should be:

1.       Title/presentation cover page

2.       Executive summary setting out clearly and concisely the main findings – 1 page maximum. 

3.       <span style="background:#b1ffff">General introduction, including background, discovery, history, current status</span>

4.       Structure and structural variability (if any).  Analyse the basic chemical structure, structural variability and the assembly of the polysaccharide

5.       Properties and linkage to polysaccharide structure.  Consider:  solubility in different solvents, crystallinity, gel structure and properties, amongst other properties

6.       Source/s and purification/isolation processes. How much raw source material is available. 

7.       Current and Future Applications and market size.   

8.       Conclusions (half page max)

9.       References

The total length of the report should be 15 pages maximum, excluding references and title page. 

  

# Submitting your Report

To submit your assignment, please use the Report submission link on the Moodle site, available under ‘Assessment Information’ and follow the instructions.  Only one person should submit as part of the group.
