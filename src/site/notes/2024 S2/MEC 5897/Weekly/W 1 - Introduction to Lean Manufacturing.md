### 2. History of lean manufacturing
- Foundations in Fordism
- Toyota Production System
- Lean Six Sigma
> Lean: 主要关注消除浪费（Muda），优化流程，提高效率。精益生产有七大浪费：过量生产、等待时间、运输、过度加工、库存、动作和缺陷
> 
> Six Sigma:侧重于减少过程中的变异，通过数据驱动的方法提高质量。其核心方法是DMAIC：定义（Define）、测量（Measure）、分析（Analyze）、改进（Improve）、控制（Control）

- Practical Steps of Lean Six Sigma
>- **定义（Define）**：明确问题、目标和客户需求。
>- **测量（Measure）**：收集数据，评估当前流程性能。
>- **分析（Analyze）**：分析数据，找出问题的根本原因。
>- **改进（Improve）**：制定和实施改进方案。
>- **控制（Control）**：建立控制措施，确保改进持续有效。

#### Key principles
- Value Stream Mapping (**VSM**)
> **步骤**：一种工具，用于识别和分析产品或服务从开始到结束的整个流程中的所有步骤，并找出每个步骤中的增值和非增值活动
1. **选择产品或流程**：选择一个具体的产品或流程进行分析。
2. **绘制当前状态图**：详细记录当前流程中的每一步骤，包括信息流、物料流、时间和库存等。
3. **识别浪费**：找出流程中非增值的步骤和浪费。
4. **绘制未来状态图**：设计优化后的流程，消除浪费，缩短时间，提高效率。
5. **实施改进**：根据未来状态图进行改进，并持续监控和调整。

- 5 S
> 工作场所组织方法，旨在创建一个整洁、有序和高效的工作环境
- **整理（Seiri, Sort）**：清理工作区域，移除不必要的物品。
- **整顿（Seiton, Set in order）**：将必要物品按使用频率和功能排列，方便取用。
- **清扫（Seiso, Shine）**：保持工作区域的清洁，定期清扫和维护设备。
- **清洁（Seiketsu, Standardize）**：制定标准操作程序，确保整理、整顿和清扫的持续进行。
- **素养（Shitsuke, Sustain）**：培养员工的良好习惯和素养，确保5S活动长期有效。

-  Kanban
>视觉管理工具，用于管理工作流程和库存水平
- **分析流程**：确定流程中的每个步骤，并设置看板板。
- **创建看板卡片**：为每个工作项或库存单位创建卡片。
- **设置限制**：为每个步骤设置在制品（Work In Progress，WIP）限制，防止过多的工作积压。
- **持续改进**：定期审查和调整看板系统，寻找改进机会。

## Pre-class
A virtual tour of a lean factory - [FastCap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYby_HczyDA&t=1s) who is making woodwork tools
[[2024 S2/MEC 5897/Attachments/Media Note - Lean Manufacturing - FastCap\|FastCap: Media notes]]





1. List all the activities you have heard or seen in this video that might be related to lean manufacturing (based on your own understanding of lean before learning our unit)?
2. Explain how these activities related to lean will affect the business of FastCap?

> **Answer:**

**Natural light and Ventilation:** The facility has 110 windows that can provide sufficient natural light to the factory. Big gas fans can keep the working environment cool, increase productivity, and reduce energy costs.

**Stand-up desks, and on wheel-Cabinets**: All office desks are made of FastPipe system standing desks, including desks and filing cabinets with wheels, which can be flexibly rearranged and co built to meet constantly changing needs and optimizable workflows, thereby improving overall work efficiency。

**Open area**: There are no walls, which not only facilitates efficient collaboration between employees, but also reduces possible obstacles in the workflow.

**Color-coded order system:** Order desk and Invoices are both color coded, which can quickly clarify the priority of tasks based on the different colors of each week, ensuring maximum efficiency.

**Kanban system**: The Kanban system of visual labels (e.g. colors, pictures and tags) is used to manage inventory and help keep production lines efficient.

**Simplified conference room**: Not only can it facilitate quick meetings and decision-making processes to reduce time, but it can also utilize the modular office supplies mentioned earlier to meet the temporary demand for additional meeting rooms.

**Shadow Boards & Kaizen Foam system for tools**: This helps to find the required tools more accurately and quickly, not only saving time in finding tools during work, but also reducing the time spent on storing after work is completed.

**Lean Dishwasher**：An efficient dishwasher can complete a task in 2 minutes, improving the efficiency of the kitchen area.

**Efficient Production Line:** The main production line leads directly to the shipping location, minimizing the streamlining of the production to shipping process.

**Scooters**: By using Scooters to overcome the problem of large factory sites, employees can save time and energy by moving between different parts to improve personal productivity

**Narrow aisle system for inventory & "KNUJ"**: A waste management system used to retrieve inventory, while utilizing visual tags to organize items that are temporarily unused in the office area. This not only improves the space utilization of the office area, keeps the work area clean and orderly, but also minimizes waste to the greatest extent possible.

**Lean procedure for Airplane**: By using lean procedures, such as distinguishing whether important switches are in the activated state through labels and red lines, safety and efficiency can be improved.

2. What are the major issues for Thrustmaster before they adopt lean methodology?  

3. What lean strategies Thrustmaster have used and how do these strategies solve the issues that Thrustmaster have?   

#### Question:
Watch the documentary related [Toyota Production System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5vtCRFRAK0), think about the following questions:
1 What inspires Toyota to develop TPS (Toyota Product System)

  

2 Why can Toyota get success?
