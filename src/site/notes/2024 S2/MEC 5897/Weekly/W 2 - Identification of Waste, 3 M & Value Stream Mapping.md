## Intro
- focus on waste and the factors behind it
- how to classify them + where they come from + how to get rid of them
- 3Ms in lean manufacturing
## Weekly objectives
- Understand what is the waste
- Be able to differentiate different types of waste
- Be able to come up with the solution when a specific type of waste is identified
- Understand 3Ms in lean
- Be able to describe the relationship between them
- Understand the basic steps to create a Value Stream Map
- Be able to apply Value Stream Map to analyse the manufacturing process/flow and identify the waste or non-value-added time
