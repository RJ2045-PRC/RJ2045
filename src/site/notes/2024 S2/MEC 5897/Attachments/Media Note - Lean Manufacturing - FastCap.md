Our CNC area makes all our molds. All toolboxes are shadowed with Kaizen foam. We have injection molding machines with robots to remove parts. All tools for the machines are shadowed, and injection molds are magnetically attached for easy identification. We use Kanban cards for materials management.

We have a narrow aisle system for retrieving inventory, allowing efficient use of space. Operators use wire-guided man-up systems to handle inventory, avoiding damage and improving speed. We have build cells in front of our inventory racks for flexibility. An automatic shrink wrapper helps with pallet loads for efficient shipping.

At FastCap, we aim for efficiency and smart work. The facility is clean, organized, and enjoyable. Even our forklift maintenance is regular and thorough.

We have a "Nudge" aisle for items we don't need, which we sort through every few months to keep our work area clean. Even our corporate plane follows lean procedures for efficiency and safety. Lean applies everywhere, from the factory floor to the cockpit.

FastCap is a place where lean principles make work enjoyable and efficient, and we even have time for fun activities like synchronized dancing with dogs. Lean is simple and fun.

# Script :

Hello everyone, it's time to take a tour of FastCap. FastCap is located in Bellingham, Washington, just about 2 hours north of Seattle in a little town called Ferndale, right on I-5. It's a beautiful place with a 50,000 sq ft facility. It's a really cool place to work, with about 110 windows allowing lots of natural light everywhere.

We're going to take you inside now. Remember, it's simple, not fancy. When you get inside, just a big overview: we have three big gas fans keeping everything cool and lots of natural light. When you walk in the front door, it's all stand-up desks made from our FastPipe system. Everything's simple. People ask if it's difficult to stand up. It takes a little time to get used to, but we love it. Everything's on wheels, including the filing cabinets, so everything is flexible.

Looking from the office back into the shipping area and from the shipping area back towards the office, you notice there are no walls. Our order desk is on wheels and color-coded based on the day of the week. Invoices are color-coded by the day of the week so we can quickly tell if we're behind or ahead. All boxes we ship in are color-coded for easy identification. LED lights and radiant heat make it an incredible place to work.

This is our grocery aisle and shipping terminal where 90% of our finished products are. We build Kanbans every day with visual controls and the last five digits of the UPC code. Pictures and labels allow us to manage our daily picking easily.

In our showroom and conference room, everything is simple and stand-up. Meetings don't last long. Our graphic design area is also stand-up and on wheels. We want to be flexible because our needs are always changing. Tools are shadowed, so we never search for anything.

Hi, I'm Graham, and welcome to Graphics. This is the most magical cell in the whole building. We produce all our labels and inserts for over 700 products right here. We have developed a six-step process for anyone to follow and get the job done in 2-3 minutes. We use a simple Kanban card system for paper replenishment.

At the end of the day, anyone can run a $150,000 printer for a giant company on their first day. Our bathrooms are beautiful with fresh flowers, granite countertops, and polished concrete floors. We keep everything sparkling clean daily with automatic floor cleaners.

This is our sandbox where we meet every morning for our morning meeting, led by a new person every day. Our kitchen is open to the entire facility with no walls, and we even have a lean dishwasher that does a load in 2 minutes. Our main production line flows towards the shipping terminals.

In another cell, we make the laser jam. Austin is laying out a tape measure on an aluminum pole to make the laser leveling device. All tools are shadowed in Kaizen foam, so work is easy and fast.

In our engineering cell, engineers work on the production floor, doing 3 D modeling and stereolithography. Our engineering team uses scooters to get around the facility. We have a shadow board for all products we make for lateral thinking. Our wood shop is immaculate, with all tools organized for high productivity.

All tools for the machines are shadowed, and injection molds are magnetically attached for easy identification. We use Kanban cards for materials management.
